# Egel code for Advent of Code 2021, day 23

This code didn't run fast enough. Part due to the sluggishness of the
interpreter, part due to the priority queue implementation (on 
arrays), maybe because it doesn't work.

Failure to be revisited.

Thanks to whomever provided the python script, it isn't mine.
